# Notarize Pair Programming Interview

Welcome to the Notarize Pair Programming Interview Repo! We're excited to have you interviewing for an engineering role with us, and we're looking forward to talking to you.

We want to do whatever we can to make this interview a good experience for you. To that end, here's some information about what you'll be doing so that you can get prepared.

You'll be participating in a pair programming session with one of our senior engineers. You'll be using the OMDB (Open Movie Database) api. This is like a mini version of IMDB. It lets you search for movies with different criteria and display various information about each result.

The main site for OMDB is http://www.omdbapi.com/ . That page describes the the api, all the parameters, and provides some examples of how to use it.

Here's what you should do between now and the day of your interview:

1. Get your OMDB api key. You'll need this to use the api. You can get a free api key here: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx . This will be good for up to 1000 requests per day. You DON'T need to become a patreon or pay any money.

2. Take some time to get familiar with the api and understand how it works. Figure out how to make calls to the api and understand the results that come back and how to parse them.

3. Clone this repo and set up whatever environment, libraries and tooling you'll need for the language and platform you'll be using. Be prepared to explain your setup and what you have installed and why.

4. You can use whatever language and frameworks you are most familiar with. If you are applying for a front end position, you will probably want to prepare to write a web application in React, Angular, Vue or whatever you are comfortable with. If you are a backend candidate, you may choose to create a command line application, or possibly a backend application that generates some simple HTML views.

5. Do NOT create a full application to bring to the interview. You'll be creating the application in the interview itself. But feel free to set up whatever scaffolding you want so that you are ready to create an application when the interview begins.

6. On the day of the interview, you'll be sharing your screen with the interviewing engineer. They'll describe the app that you will build together. Depending on the role you are applying for, this could be a front end web or mobile app or a backend app that consumes the OMDB api.

7. When you are done with the interview, commit the code back to the repo.

If you have any questions about the process or what to expect, feel free to contact keith@notarize.com.

Best of luck! No matter how it goes, we'd also like to hear any feedback you have about the process and how we might be able to make it better. Again, contact keith@notarize.com
